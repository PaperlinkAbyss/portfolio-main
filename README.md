# Introduction

Hi! My name is John, a Spanish "programmer", and this is my porfolio. (Duh)

At first I thought uploading each proyect on a different repository (which is the most common way as far as I've seen), but some of my proyects are very small in scale (A color picker, tick-tack-toe, etc) so I thought it would be nice if I just had it all here so it's faster to check. However this portfolio will only contain 3 webs and 3 games since I think it has already grown enough, from now on each thing will have it's own repository on github.

## Stack

-   Next
-   Typescript
-   Tailwind
-   EmblaCarousel(For one page)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have node installed along npm before starting.
2. Download this repository from GitHub.
3. Extract it and open a new terminal where you unzipped the repository.
4. Run the command:
   `npm i`
5. Run the command:
   `npm run dev`
6. Open localhost:3000 and navigate the pages.

## Structure

In case you don't want to run the page you can manually type the route since all proyects follow this pattern:

```
pages/
├─ webs/
│  ├─ proyect_name/
├─ games/
│  ├─ game_name/

```

The index and all the web has a floating navbar to easily navigate from one project to another.
