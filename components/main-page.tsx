                My very first page done from 0 with styling. It&apos;s a very simple copy of the
                original (
                <a
                  className='underline'

                  conatel.biz
                </a>
                ). I finished a programming course and got in this business for practices (80h, 4h a
                day for 4 weeks). They used wordpress and didn&apos;t need much from me so by the
                second day I already finished upgrading things and had free time so I decided to
                copy their whole page, changing some styling and grouping things differently. I also
                ended up adding some more features that didn&apos;t get into my copy (mainly √Årea
                privada). They were very nice and I had a lot of fun with them, they even allowed me
                to publish it here as my portfolio so I&apos;m very thankful.

                This landing was actually my very first page I created. I did it along the Pokedex
                to prove someone my level of programming (which was very low since I had only been
                studying it for like 2 months).

                It was meant to be bigger but I was only given a week to do it, and it was quite
                overwhelming since at the same time I started using TypeScript and Tailwind.

                On this project I learned how to use fetch and got my very first (and only) decent
                design. This one was very fun to do because I had never used APIs. There was also a
                problem moving it to this portfolio, since I did it using Redux as per requested by
                the ones who were testing me. Even at that time I felt Redux was overkill for such a
                small page, but I do see the need of taking the state out of react for this one. I
                will probably move the pokemons to a db or try Zustand.

                This game was actually something that popped up on my instagram while I was in
                Conatel. It looked very fun to do so I tried. It was quite fast and easy to do, but
                my mind told me: You can make it harder (for no reason) so I did. I added more color
                spaces, options for difficulty... And it was madness at first. But very fun to do in
                general.

                I actually limited myself with this one. It was meant to be a 3x3 by default that
                could be expanded to nxn on size. I decided implementing it 3x3 was enough (

                This page is more like a &quot;game&quot; but it&apos;s actually neither a game or a
                web. This project was born from a necessity of a friend. She was meant to create
                some kind of art for an exposition (

                ) in honor of her deceased art teacher Jabier Villarreal. She decided to do an
                embroidery proyect but wanted to mix traditional basque art (basque embroidery
                patterns) with modern technologies. So she ended up doing it on processing, however
                it was quite tedious since she had never studied programming before and needed to
                create 625 tiles per canvas. At that moment I decided to make it a little bit more
                automatic with some loops. I was going to give it some extra styling so it
                wasn&apos;t as ugly but she told me not to (blame her).

                Creating this app was quite weird because I didn&apos;t opt to make it 100% in the
                react way, the main reason being the opposite of the Pokedex, the state would be so
                big it&apos;s probably gonna be very bad for performance.
